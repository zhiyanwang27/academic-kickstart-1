I'm a Ph.D. candidate at the Lab for Cognitive and Perceptual Learning at Brown University. My research interests include the mechanisms of visual perceptual learning and how sleep influences the plasticity. I use computational modeling as well as computational imaging to understand the dynamics of plasticity in human visual system with experience. I'm also obtaining a doctoral certificate in data science. 

In my leisure time, I play tennis regularly. During winter, I'm a snowboarder in the mountains. I speak English and Mandarin. I also speak some Japanese, Spanish and a little Russian and French.
